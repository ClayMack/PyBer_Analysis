# Pyber analysis

* Use Jupyter Notebooks

* Use Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Numpy to analyze ride sharing data 

* Track ride sharing trends based on key metrics to make recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types (Urban, Suburban, and Rural)

## Overview of the Pyber analysis:

* Using Jupyter Notebooks, load Matplotlib and pandas
* load data from two csv files (city and ride data) and merge into a single dataframe.
* Create data frames to calculate data metrics using groupby, sum, pivot, resample, and loc functions
* Create various plots for trend analysis using Matplotlib

## Challenge Objective:
Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. To finalize, submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer

## Results:
Describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types
