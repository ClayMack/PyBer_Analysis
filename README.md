# Pyber analysis

* Use Jupyter Notebooks

* Use Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Numpy to analyze ride sharing data 

* Track ride sharing trends based on key metrics to make recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types (Urban, Suburban, and Rural)

## Overview of the Pyber analysis:

* Using Jupyter Notebooks, load Matplotlib and pandas
* load data from two csv files (city and ride data) and merge into a single dataframe.
* Create data frames to calculate data metrics using groupby, sum, pivot, resample, and loc functions
* Create various plots for trend analysis using Matplotlib

## Challenge Objective:
Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. To finalize, submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer

## Results:
Ride-sharing data among the different city types:

![Pyber Summary by City Type.](https://github.com/ClayMack/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Fig9.png "Pyber Summary by City Type.")

* The data shows that there are more rides and drivers in Urban cities compared to Suburban and Rural cities. Due to supply and demand the average fare per ride is the lowest, yet does bring in the most revenue compared to the other cities types combined
* Rural cities tend to have very few drivers and rides which probably corresponds to each other. Rural cities by fare contribute the least revenue to Pyber
* Suburban cities show to in between the two other city types and contributes just under half of the total revenue to Pyber 
* An intersting observation is that there are more drivers in Urban cities than the total rides. This indicates an oversaturation of drivers and could possibly lead to high turnover 



## Summary:
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
